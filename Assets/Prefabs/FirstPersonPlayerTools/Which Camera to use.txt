Check that you have both "Camera" and "CameraTouchpadWalking" in your scene.
If you don't have either one, just drag one into the scene.

How to toggle
- Toggle active or not by clicking the object (Camera/CameraTouchpadWalking) on the scene
- On the inspector you should see a tickbox beside the name. Click on it to toggle on/off
- Object is active when the tickbox has a "tick"
- Object is NOT active when the tickbox does not have a "tick"


Q&A

- What happens if I use "CameraTouchpadWalking" when I'm not using the VR?
	- You cannot move your camera to inspect your work. This camera works only for VR.

- What happens if I use "Camera" when I'm using VR?
	- Your camera placement will be off and you cannot move. This camera is NOT optimized for VR use.

- What happens if I use BOTH in either VR or PC?
	- Your camera mechanics will go haywire. Try it for yourself if you want to see what I mean.

- What happens if I have multiple copies of "Camera" present?
	- There will be double calculations which will affect performance. Do not do this.
